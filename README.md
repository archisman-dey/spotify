### Manas Hostel - Kriti 2019, IIT Guwahati

Given a rectangular region and 4 bots placed randomly within the region, take their current and final position coordinates from a webserver and move them to their final positions while avoiding collisions and accidentally going outside the region.

This is done by using an Arduino Uno connected to my laptop as a 'master' and 4 bots driven by Arduino Uno's as a 'slave' communicating via RF transmitters and receivers.
